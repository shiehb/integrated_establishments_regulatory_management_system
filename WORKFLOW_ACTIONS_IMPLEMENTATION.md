# Inspection Workflow Actions Implementation

## ✅ **Complete Workflow Actions Following Diagram**

I have successfully implemented all the specific workflow actions from the inspection workflow diagram:

### 🎯 **Workflow Actions by Status**

#### **1. DIVISION_CREATED**
- **Action**: Forward to Section Chief
- **Next Status**: SECTION_REVIEW
- **Logic**: Auto-assign to Section Chief based on section matching

#### **2. SECTION_REVIEW** 
- **Actions Available**:
  - **Start Inspection** → SECTION_INSPECTING
  - **Forward to Unit Head** (if Unit Head exists for PD-1586, RA-8749, RA-9275) →  
  - **Forward to Monitoring** (if no Unit Head) → MONITORING_ASSIGN

#### **3. SECTION_INSPECTING**
- **Actions Available**:
  - **Complete Inspection** → COMPLETED
  - **Forward to Unit Head** (if exists) → UNIT_REVIEW
  - **Forward to Monitoring** (if no Unit Head) → MONITORING_ASSIGN

#### **4. UNIT_REVIEW**
- **Actions Available**:
  - **Start Inspection** → UNIT_INSPECTING
  - **Forward to Monitoring** → MONITORING_ASSIGN

#### **5. UNIT_INSPECTING**
- **Actions Available**:
  - **Complete Inspection** → COMPLETED
  - **Forward to Monitoring** → MONITORING_ASSIGN

#### **6. MONITORING_ASSIGN**
- **Action**: Start Monitoring Inspection → MONITORING_INSPECTION

#### **7. MONITORING_INSPECTION**
- **Actions Available**:
  - **Complete - Compliant ✅** → COMPLETED (Return path: Monitoring → Unit Head → Section Chief → Division Chief)
  - **Complete - Non-Compliant ❌** → LEGAL_REVIEW (Return path: Monitoring → Unit Head → Section Chief → Division Chief → Legal Unit)

#### **8. LEGAL_REVIEW**
- **Action**: Complete Legal Review → COMPLETED

### 🔄 **Auto-Assignment Logic**

#### **Section Chief Assignment**
- Match section (PD-1586, RA-6969, RA-8749, RA-9275, RA-9003)
- Prioritize same district
- Fallback to any active Section Chief for the section

#### **Unit Head Assignment**
- Only for sections: PD-1586 (EIA), RA-8749 (Air), RA-9275 (Water)
- Match section and district
- Fallback to any active Unit Head for the section

#### **Monitoring Personnel Assignment**
- Match section AND district
- Must have both district and law matching
- No fallback - must find exact match

### 📊 **Compliance Tracking**

#### **Compliant Inspection ✅**
```
Monitoring Personnel → Unit Head → Section Chief → Division Chief → FINAL CLOSE
```

#### **Non-Compliant Inspection ❌**
```
Monitoring Personnel → Unit Head → Section Chief → Division Chief → Legal Unit → LEGAL ACTION
```

#### **Compliance Features**
- **Violation Tracking**: Multiple violation types
- **Compliance Plan**: Required corrective actions
- **Compliance Deadline**: Set compliance date
- **Penalties & Fines**: Warning, fines, suspension, revocation
- **Legal Actions**: NOV (Notice of Violation), NOO (Notice of Order)
