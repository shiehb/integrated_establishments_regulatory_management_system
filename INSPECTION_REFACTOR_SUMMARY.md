# Inspection System Refactor Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive refactor of the inspection system to implement the structured workflow rules as specified.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Model Updates (`server/inspections/models.py`)

#### Status Choices Updated
- **Added**: `MONITORING_ASSIGN` status for monitoring personnel assignment
- **Reordered**: Status choices to reflect the new workflow flow
- **Default**: Changed from `PENDING` to `DIVISION_CREATED`

#### New Action Choices
- **Added**: `FORWARD_TO_UNIT` for Section Chief to Unit Head forwarding
- **Added**: `COMPLETE_COMPLIANT` and `COMPLETE_NON_COMPLIANT` for compliance decisions

#### Compliance Tracking Fields
- `compliance_status`: Overall compliance status (PENDING, COMPLIANT, NON_COMPLIANT, PARTIALLY_COMPLIANT)
- `compliance_notes`: Detailed compliance assessment
- `violations_found`: List of violations found during inspection
- `compliance_plan`: Establishment's compliance plan
- `compliance_deadline`: Deadline for compliance

#### Legal Unit Tracking Fields
- `notice_of_violation_sent`: Boolean flag for NOV sent
- `notice_of_order_sent`: Boolean flag for NOO sent
- `penalties_imposed`: Text field for penalties and fines
- `legal_unit_comments`: Legal unit assessment and recommendations

#### New Methods
- `_has_unit_head_for_section()`: Check if Unit Head exists for section
- `_return_compliant_inspection()`: Handle compliant inspection return path
- `_return_non_compliant_inspection()`: Handle non-compliant inspection return path
- `forward_to_legal_unit()`: Forward non-compliant inspection to Legal Unit

### 2. Workflow Logic Updates

#### Auto-Assignment Rules
- **Section Chief**: Match section and prioritize same district
- **Unit Head**: Only for EIA, Air, Water sections (PD-1586, RA-8749, RA-9275)
- **Monitoring Personnel**: Must match both district AND law/section

#### Forward Rules Implementation
- **If Unit Head exists**: Section Chief → Unit Head (UNIT_REVIEW)
- **If no Unit Head**: Section Chief → Monitoring Personnel (MONITORING_ASSIGN)

#### Compliance Return Paths
- **Compliant**: Monitoring → Unit Head → Section Chief → Division Chief (Final Close)
- **Non-Compliant**: Monitoring → Unit Head → Section Chief → Division Chief → Legal Unit

### 3. API Updates (`server/inspections/views.py`)

#### Tab-Based Filtering
- **Section Chief Tabs**:
  - `created_inspections`: New inspections from Division Chief
  - `my_inspections`: Inspections they chose to work on
  - `forwarded_list`: Inspections they forwarded
- **Unit Head Tabs**:
  - `received_from_section`: Inspections from Section Chief
  - `my_inspections`: Inspections they chose to work on
  - `forwarded_list`: Inspections they forwarded to Monitoring

#### New Endpoints
- `GET /api/inspections/tab_counts/`: Get tab counts for dashboard
- Enhanced `POST /api/inspections/{id}/make_decision/`: Support compliance data

### 4. Serializer Updates (`server/inspections/serializers.py`)

#### New Fields
- `compliance_info`: Comprehensive compliance tracking information
- Enhanced `WorkflowDecisionSerializer` with compliance fields

### 5. Database Migration (`server/inspections/migrations/0010_add_compliance_tracking.py`)
- Added all new compliance tracking fields
- Updated status and action choices
- Maintained backward compatibility

## Workflow Implementation

### Division Chief
- Creates inspections (status = DIVISION_CREATED)
- Forwards to Section Chief (status = SECTION_REVIEW)

### Section Chief (3 Tabs)
1. **Created Inspections**: New inspections from Division Chief
2. **My Inspections**: Inspections they chose to work on (after Inspect button)
3. **Forwarded List**: Inspections they forwarded to Unit Head/Monitoring

**Actions Available**:
- Inspect: Change status to SECTION_INSPECTING
- Forward to Unit Head: If Unit Head exists → UNIT_REVIEW
- Forward to Monitoring: If no Unit Head → MONITORING_ASSIGN

### Unit Head (3 Tabs)
1. **Received from Section**: Inspections from Section Chief
2. **My Inspections**: Inspections they chose to work on (after Inspect button)
3. **Forwarded List**: Inspections they forwarded to Monitoring

**Actions Available**:
- Inspect: Change status to UNIT_INSPECTING
- Forward to Monitoring: Always → MONITORING_ASSIGN

### Monitoring Personnel
- Single list of assigned inspections
- **Auto-Assignment Rule**: Match establishment district + law/section with monitoring personnel
- **Actions**: Complete with compliance decision
  - Compliant: Return through workflow chain
  - Non-Compliant: Forward to Legal Unit

### Legal Unit
- Reviews non-compliant cases
- Manages Notice of Violation (NOV) and Notice of Order (NOO)
- Tracks penalties and compliance deadlines

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Structured Tab System**: Clear organization for different user levels
2. **Auto-Assignment**: Intelligent matching based on district and law
3. **Conditional Routing**: Unit Head routing only when Unit Head exists
4. **Compliance Tracking**: Separate paths for compliant vs non-compliant inspections
5. **Legal Integration**: Automatic forwarding to Legal Unit for violations
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete workflow history tracking
7. **District + Law Matching**: Precise monitoring personnel assignment

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `server/inspections/models.py` - Core model updates
- `server/inspections/views.py` - API endpoints and tab logic
- `server/inspections/serializers.py` - Data serialization
- `server/inspections/migrations/0010_add_compliance_tracking.py` - Database migration

### Documentation
- `INSPECTION_WORKFLOW_DIAGRAM.md` - Complete workflow visualization
- `INSPECTION_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Migration**: Run `python manage.py migrate inspections` to apply database changes
2. **Frontend Updates**: Update React components to use new tab structure and API endpoints
3. **Testing**: Test the complete workflow with different user levels and scenarios
4. **User Training**: Provide training on the new tab structure and workflow

## Benefits

1. **Clear Workflow**: Structured, predictable inspection flow
2. **Efficient Assignment**: Automatic matching reduces manual assignment
3. **Compliance Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of violations and compliance
4. **Legal Integration**: Seamless integration with legal processes
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all workflow decisions
6. **Scalability**: System can handle multiple districts and laws efficiently
