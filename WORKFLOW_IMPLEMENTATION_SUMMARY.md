# Inspection Workflow Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Completed Implementation**

### 🎯 **Workflow Structure Following Diagram**

I have successfully implemented the complete inspection workflow system following the exact workflow diagram rules:

#### **Role-Based Tab Structure**

1. **Division Chief**
   - Tab 1: All Inspections
   - Tab 2: Created by Me  
   - Tab 3: **By Section/Law** (Special overview tab)

2. **Section Chief** (3 Tabs)
   - Tab 1: Created Inspections (from Division Chief)
   - Tab 2: My Inspections (after Inspect button)
   - Tab 3: Forwarded List (to Unit Head/Monitoring)

3. **Unit Head** (3 Tabs)
   - Tab 1: Received from Section
   - Tab 2: My Inspections (after Inspect button)
   - Tab 3: Forwarded List (to Monitoring)

4. **Monitoring Personnel**
   - Tab 1: Assigned Inspections (auto-assigned)

5. **Legal Unit**
   - Tab 1: Legal Review (non-compliant cases)

### 🧙‍♂️ **Inspection Wizard Implementation**

Created a comprehensive 5-step wizard following the old code pattern:

#### **Wizard Steps**
1. **Basic Information** - Section/Law, Type, Priority, Date, Description
2. **Establishment Details** - Search and select establishment
3. **Inspection Scope** - Select inspection areas and requirements
4. **Assignment** - Section Chief, Unit Head (optional), Auto-assignment for Monitoring
5. **Review & Create** - Summary and final creation

#### **Key Features**
- **Step-by-step validation** with error handling
- **Progress indicator** with visual steps
- **Auto-assignment logic** for Monitoring Personnel
- **Establishment search** with filtering
- **Section/Law selection** with proper mapping
- **Document requirements** selection

### 🏢 **Division Chief Section/Law Tab**

Created a special overview tab for Division Chief showing:

#### **Section Overview Cards**
- **PD-1586**: EIA Monitoring
- **RA-8749**: Air Quality Monitoring  
- **RA-9275**: Water Quality Monitoring
- **RA-6969**: Toxic Chemicals Monitoring
- **RA-9003**: Solid Waste Management

#### **Each Section Shows**
- Total inspections count
- Pending/In Progress/Completed breakdown
- Associated establishments
- Quick actions (View Details, New Inspection)

#### **Summary Dashboard**
- Total sections count
- Overall pending/in progress/completed statistics
- Visual cards with icons and counts

### 🔄 **Workflow Status Implementation**

#### **Status Flow Following Diagram**
```
DIVISION_CREATED → SECTION_REVIEW → SECTION_INSPECTING → COMPLETED
                ↓
                UNIT_REVIEW → UNIT_INSPECTING → MONITORING_ASSIGN
                ↓
                MONITORING_INSPECTION → COMPLETED/LEGAL_REVIEW
```

#### **Role-Based Actions**
- **Division Chief**: Create → Forward to Section Chief
- **Section Chief**: Inspect → Complete OR Forward (Unit Head if exists, else Monitoring)
- **Unit Head**: Inspect → Complete OR Forward to Monitoring
- **Monitoring Personnel**: Inspect → Complete (Compliant/Non-Compliant)
- **Legal Unit**: Review non-compliant cases

### 🎨 **UI/UX Features**

- **Role-based tabs** that change based on user level
- **Active tab highlighting** with sky-600 color scheme
- **Tab counts** showing number of items in each tab
- **Smooth transitions** between tabs

#### **User Level Selector**
- **Demo controls** for testing different user levels

#### **Visual Design**

- **Sky-600 primary color** matching your theme
- **Responsive layout** for all screen sizes
- **Loading states** and error handling

### 📊 **Data Management**

#### **Mock Data Structure**
- **Role-based filtering** with realistic inspection data
- **Status-based organization** following workflow rules
- **Establishment details** with district information
- **Assignment tracking** with personnel names

#### **API Integration Ready**
- **Tab parameter** for server-side filtering

### 📁 **File Structure**

```

## 🎯 **Usage Instructions**

1. **Select User Level** from the demo controls dropdown
2. **Navigate tabs** to see role-specific interfaces
3. **Create inspections** using the 5-step wizard
