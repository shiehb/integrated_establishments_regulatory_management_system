# User Model Normalization Summary

## What Was Accomplished

I have successfully created a comprehensive database normalization solution for your user account models. Here's what was delivered:

### 1. **Normalized Models** (`models_normalized.py`)
- **UserLevel Model**: Centralized management of user levels/roles with configurable constraints
- **Section Model**: Normalized sections/laws with support for combined sections
- **District Model**: Normalized districts with province grouping
- **UserProfile Model**: Extended user profile information
- **UserAssignmentHistory Model**: Complete audit trail of user assignment changes
- **UserPermission Model**: Granular permission management with time-based permissions
- **Refactored User Model**: Uses foreign keys to normalized models with database-enforced constraints

### 2. **Migration Scripts**
- **0001_normalize_user_models.py**: Creates all normalized tables with proper relationships and indexes
- **0002_populate_normalized_user_data.py**: Populates normalized tables with initial data

### 3. **Management Command** (`populate_normalized_user_data.py`)
- Command to populate normalized tables with data from hardcoded choices
- Can be run with: `python manage.py populate_normalized_user_data`

### 4. **Updated Serializers** (`serializers_normalized.py`)
- Complete set of serializers for all normalized models
- Includes nested serializers for related objects
- Proper handling of read-only fields and computed fields
- Database-enforced validation

### 5. **Updated Views** (`views_normalized.py`)
- ViewSets for all normalized models
- Proper filtering and querying capabilities
- User permission handling
- Assignment history tracking
- District assignment functionality

### 6. **Documentation**
- **USER_MODEL_NORMALIZATION_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive guide explaining the normalization
- **USER_NORMALIZATION_SUMMARY.md**: This summary document

## Key Benefits of the Normalization

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Easy to add new user levels, sections, districts without code changes
- Centralized management of reference data
- Consistent data across the system
- Database-enforced business rules

### 2. **Performance**
- Better query performance with proper indexes
- Reduced data duplication
- More efficient joins
- Optimized database queries

### 3. **Data Integrity**
- Referential integrity constraints
- Consistent data validation
- Better error handling
- Database-level enforcement of business rules

### 4. **Scalability**
- Easy to extend with new features
- Better separation of concerns
- More flexible configuration
- Dynamic business rules

### 5. **Auditability**
- Complete audit trail of user changes
- User assignment history
- Permission tracking
- Compliance reporting

## How to Implement

### Step 1: Review the Normalized Models
Examine `server/users/models_normalized.py` to understand the new structure.

### Step 2: Run the Migrations
```bash
cd server
python manage.py makemigrations users
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 3: Populate Normalized Data
```bash
python manage.py populate_normalized_user_data
```

### Step 4: Update Your Code
Replace references to the old models with the new normalized models:
- Update imports
- Update queries to use foreign keys
- Update serializers and views

### Step 5: Test the Implementation
- Test all user management workflows
- Verify data integrity
- Check performance improvements

## Example Usage

### Adding a New User Level
```python
# Instead of hardcoding in the model
UserLevel.objects.create(
    code='Supervisor',
    name='Supervisor',
    description='Supervisory role with limited permissions',
    requires_section=True,
    requires_district=False,
    max_active_users=None,
    max_active_per_section=2,
    max_active_per_district=None
)
```

### Adding a New Section
```python
# Instead of hardcoding in the model
Section.objects.create(
    code='RA-1234',
    name='New Environmental Law',
    description='Description of the new law',
    is_combined=False
)
```

### Configuring User Level Constraints
```python
# Update existing user level constraints
user_level = UserLevel.objects.get(code='Section Chief')
user_level.max_active_per_section = 2  # Allow 2 per section
user_level.requires_district = True    # Now requires district
user_level.save()
```

### Querying with Normalized Models
```python
# Get all users for a specific user level
users = User.objects.filter(userlevel__code='Section Chief')

# Get all users in a specific section
users = User.objects.filter(section__code='PD-1586')

# Get all users in a specific district
users = User.objects.filter(district__code='LU-1')

# Get users with specific permissions
users = User.objects.filter(permissions__permission_code='manage_inspections')
```

## Migration Strategy

### For Development
1. Create a backup of your current database
2. Run the migrations in a development environment
3. Test all functionality
4. Update your application code
5. Test again

### For Production
1. **Plan the migration window** (downtime may be required)
2. **Create a full database backup**
3. **Run the migrations**
4. **Populate the normalized data**
5. **Update the application code**
6. **Test the system**
7. **Monitor for issues**

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Stop the application
2. Restore from backup
3. Revert the migrations
4. Restore original models if needed
